# Jenkins Javadoc Plugin

This plugin adds Javadoc support to Jenkins.

The plugin provides a "Publish Javadoc" post-build action, specifying the directory where the Javadoc is to be gathered and if retention is expected for each successful build.

Pipeline jobs can publish Javadoc using the [`javadoc`](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/javadoc/) step.
